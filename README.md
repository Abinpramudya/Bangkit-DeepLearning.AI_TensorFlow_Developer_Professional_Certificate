# DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer

This README provides an overview of my progress in the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer specialization.

## Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning | Grade: 98%
This course offered valuable insights into best practices for leveraging TensorFlow, a widely used open-source machine learning framework. I acquired the ability to construct foundational neural networks within TensorFlow and learned to train them for computer vision applications. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of employing convolutions to enhance neural network performance.

## Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow | Grade: 94%
This course provided an in-depth understanding of handling real-world image data. I gained proficiency in visualizing loss and accuracy metrics to evaluate model performance. I explored strategies to prevent overfitting, including practical techniques like augmentation and dropout. Furthermore, the course equipped me with the knowledge of transfer learning and the valuable skill of extracting learned features from models.

## Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow | Grade: 98%
In this course, I gained comprehensive knowledge in building natural language processing systems using TensorFlow. The curriculum covered essential aspects, including text processing techniques like tokenization and representing sentences as vectors. I also delved into the application of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), gated recurrent units (GRUs), and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) within the TensorFlow framework. Moreover, I acquired the practical skills to train LSTMs on existing text, enabling the creation of original poetry and other text-based outputs.

## Sequences, Time Series and Prediction | Grade: 98%
This course equipped me with expertise in tackling time series and forecasting challenges using TensorFlow. It covered effective methodologies for data preparation tailored specifically for time series learning. I explored the applications of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) in making accurate predictions. Additionally, I applied these principles to construct a sunspot prediction model using real-world data, cementing my practical understanding of the subject matter.
